# Online Banking System - Configuration Files

## Overview
This directory contains configuration files necessary for setting up and running the backend server. The primary configuration file is `db.js`, which establishes the connection to the MySQL database using Sequelize.

## Files
- **db.js**: Configures and initializes the connection to the MySQL database using Sequelize.

## Usage
- `db.js` is imported in the main server file (`server.js`) and in the model files (`User.js`, `Account.js`, `Transaction.js`) to interact with the database.

## Database Configuration
- Ensure that the database credentials (host, username, password, and database name) are correctly set in the `.env` file at the root of the backend directory.
- The Sequelize instance in `db.js` uses these credentials to establish a connection with the MySQL database.
